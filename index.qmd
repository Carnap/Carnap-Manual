# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a guide to using Carnap for teaching and learning logic. 

Here's an example of what Carnap can do:

<carnap-elt data-carnap-type="proofchecker"
data-carnap-goal=":|-:((P->Q)->P)->P"
data-carnap-submission="none"
data-carnap-system="prop"
data-carnap-guides="montague"
data-carnap-options="font">
    Show ((P -> Q)-> P) -> P
</carnap-elt>

It's still very much a work in progress. Please consider contributing!
